"""Content Creation Pipeline - Main Entry Point

This script demonstrates the proper OpenAI Agents SDK usage pattern for running
a multi-agent workflow from topic selection through research.

Usage:
    python main.py

The pipeline:
1. Topic Selector - selects a topic from Notion backlog and promotes to candidate
2. Researcher - researches the selected topic and produces digest + citations
