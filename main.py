You have received a research handoff with the following topic data:

- **Topic**: {topic_data.topic}
- **Angle**: {topic_data.angle}  
- **Stance**: {topic_data.stance}
- **Page ID**: {topic_data.page_id}
- **Audience**: {topic_data.audience}
- **Geo Focus**: {topic_data.geo_focus}
- **Time Window**: {topic_data.time_window}

Execute your complete research workflow as defined in your instructions:

1. Update topic status to 'Research' using the page_id
2. Conduct comprehensive web search on the topic and angle
3. Search for recent news and developments
4. Extract detailed content from the most relevant sources
5. Compile findings into a comprehensive research report
6. Save the research to a new Notion page
7. Update topic status to 'Complete'

Use your available MCP tools to execute each step. Focus on the specific topic, angle, and stance provided. Provide detailed, substantive research content with proper citations."""
