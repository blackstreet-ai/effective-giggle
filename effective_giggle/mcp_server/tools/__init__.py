"""Tools module for Effective Giggle MCP Server

This module contains all tool implementations that are exposed through
the MCP server. Tools are organized by functional area:

- notion_tools.py: Notion database operations and topic management
- research_tools.py: Web research and citation gathering (future)
- content_tools.py: Script writing and TTS tools (future)
- youtube_tools.py: Upload and metadata management tools (future)

Each tool module should export a registration function that returns
a dictionary of tool implementations with their metadata.
